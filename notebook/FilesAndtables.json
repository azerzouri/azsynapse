(\"Corp\") was formed in 1983 to purchase Atlantic Plumbing Supply located in Long Branch, NJ.   Atlantic Plumbing Supply had been in business for 50+ years prior to being sold.  At the time of the purchase Corp purchased the inventory under an \"asset-purchase agreement\" Corp. did not purchase customer lists or accounts receivable.  They did not assume any debts or obligations of Atlantic Plumbing Supply.  Atlantic Plumbing and Corp were identical; they were in the business of distributing plumbing supplies.  Corp. kept two employees of Atlantic Plumbing Supply on the payroll, the bookkeeper and a warehouseman.  There was no 'goodwill\" purchased.  Atlantic Plumbing Supply had a few old customers and they were preparing to shut down so there was little \"good will\".  Corp. advised the only asbestos products which it may have purchased as part of the sales agreement would have been a small amount of transite pipe and it believes it was subsequently thrown out.",
